# Bioengineered viral vectors for killing prostate cancer cells

- original paper: [Lentiviruses with trastuzumab bound to their envelopes can target and kill prostate cancer cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19373278/)

- "The probasin-derived ARR2PB promoter has been shown to be capable of directing tightly controlled prostate-specific gene expression"
    - 18: [Characterization of two cis-acting DNA elements involved in the androgen regulation of the probasin gene](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8446105)
- used **tissue-specific promoter** for virus replication
- It has been demonstrated that when a complex 5â€²UTR fragment of **FGF-2** is placed in front of a reporter or therapeutic genes, it could efficiently restrict the expression of these genes to cancer cells.
