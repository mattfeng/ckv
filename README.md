# Cancer-killing virus (CKV)

## Problem breakdown
- BASIC. Basics of cancer biology
- CKV-G1. Target: Specifically targeting cancer cells
- CKV-G2. Effector: Killing cancer cells without downstream effects
- CKV-G3. Safety
  - The virus must not damage healthy cells.
  - The virus must not cause a serious immune response.

## Indications to focus on?
- Prostate
- Pancreatic
- Breast
